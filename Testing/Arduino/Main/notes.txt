today is 4th of jan 2022 and as of today im closing the e bike project after the "catastrophic" event of the motor shaft snapping in half yesterday. Im not sure when or if im ever gonna revisit this project but if i do this is a short note for future me to pick off where i left. So here it is,
first of all the motor is currently broken. secondly the code is also broken. Details on the broken code {1. it somehow has like a 1 sec response delay in main.ino(i think i added a delay by mistake) 2.i was working on multisoundtest and the number 5 sound is the best one i hav yet i think. 3. i hav a backup for the whole main.ino called main_backup.ino i was planning to revert back to that 4. the bld work with esp32servo library 5. i got ble and bt classic working together just google how}
to my future self: pls revisit this project, i want this to work badly.it was a pleasure working with u :)
